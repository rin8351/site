During the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLMC) was [used](https://txarchives.org/hrdi/finding_aids/00004.xml) as a powerful tool for spreading hate and inciting violence against the Tutsis and moderate Hutus. This station, broadcasting extremist rhetoric and false information, played a crucial role in fueling the flames of the genocide, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
