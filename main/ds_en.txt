During the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLMC) was used as a powerful tool for spreading hate and inciting violence against the Tutsis and moderate Hutus. This station, broadcasting extremist rhetoric and false information, played a crucial role in fueling the flames of the genocide, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.

This example vividly demonstrates how media can be used for dehumanization, inciting conflicts and violence, emphasizing the critical importance of responsible use of information platforms. Humanity should learn lessons from the past to prevent similar tragedies in the future and apply a culture of peaceful and responsible media formation. In this context, it is also important to maintain freedom of speech and media diversity as key elements of a healthy society and a counterbalance to the monopolization of opinions."
